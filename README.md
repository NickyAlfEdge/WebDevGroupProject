# WebDevGroupProject

SSIT MSc Web Development group project, in which we had to create a pet adoption website. 

Attained a grade of 75%.

Within this project we developed a multifaceted system, whereby admin users would be faced with a different system to standard users. Effectively implementing user control, as non-logged in users would be unable to apply for the adoption of an animal, in addition to being unable to post comments. However, an authenticated user would be able to carry out this functionality, further to this administrators while logged in would be faced with management tools. Allowing for them to add, remove, accept, or decline animal adoptions.

An example of this website can be seen in the following sub-heading.
